# RPS-League
 An android game where you can play Rock Paper Scissors against others online, but with a slight twist.
 
 To install and play the game, download from the Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DefaultCompany.RPSLeague&hl=en_US

Auto Letterbox and LeanTween are both free assets downloaded from the Unity Asset Store. Auto Letterbox assists in standardizing screen sizes of Android devices, as there are a huge variety of them. It does this through creating black bars on the sides to maintain a single resolution.
LeanTween is an asset that can be used for tweening objects. It was used to create animations for the UI elements in the game.
Networking was done through Photon.

Within the assets folder, you will find my C# scripts as well as other files essential to the game.
